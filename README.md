## Hello! I'm Ava ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a Data Analyst with a unique twist â€“ I also bring the precision and creativity of a part-time Chef to my problem-solving approach. I'm passionate about transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that drive real-world impact.

### About Me
My journey is all about making sense of complexity, whether it's optimizing a financial process or perfecting a recipe. I thrive on uncovering patterns, streamlining operations, and building compelling narratives from data. My background in Mathematics & Statistics provides a strong quantitative foundation, complemented by practical experience in diverse environments.

I believe in bridging the gap between technical details and business understanding, making data accessible and useful for everyone.

### What I Do
I specialize in the full data lifecycle, from cleaning and analysis to visualization and strategic recommendation. My toolkit includes:

* Data Analysis & Manipulation: SQL (Joins, Sub Queries, Window Functions), Python (pandas, numpy, scipy), SAS (Data Steps and Procs), Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables)

* Data Visualization & Reporting: Tableau, PowerBI

* Database Design: Understanding and creating Entity Relationship Diagrams

* Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing, Time-Series Forecasting

* Process Optimization & Automation: Identifying inefficiencies and implementing solutions

* Communication: Explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences
